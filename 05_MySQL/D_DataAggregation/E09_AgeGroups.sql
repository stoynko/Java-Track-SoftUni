-- Write down a query that creates 7 different groups based on their age.
-- Age groups should be as follows:
-- •	[0-10]
-- •	[11-20]
-- •	[21-30]
-- •	[31-40]
-- •	[41-50]
-- •	[51-60]
-- •	[61+]
-- The query should return:
-- •	Age groups
-- •	Count of wizards in it
-- Sort result by increasing size of age groups.
