-- Write a stored procedure usp_raise_salary_by_id(id) that raises a given employee's salary (by id as parameter) by 5%.
-- Consider that you cannot promote an employee that doesn't exist â€“ if that happens, no changes to the database should be made.
-- Submit your queries using the "MySQL Run Skeleton, run queries and check DB" strategy.
