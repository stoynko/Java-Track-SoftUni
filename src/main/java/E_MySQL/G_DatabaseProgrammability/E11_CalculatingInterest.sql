-- Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_calculate_future_value_for_account that accepts as parameters â€“ id of account and interest rate.
-- The procedure uses the function from the previous problem to give an interest to a person's account for 5 years, along with information about his/her account id,
-- first name, last name and current balance as it is shown in the example below. It should take the account_id and the interest_rate as parameters.
-- Interest rate should have precision up to 0.0001, same as the calculated balance after 5 years.
-- Be extremely careful to achieve the desired precision!
-- Submit your query statement as Run skeleton, run queries & check DB in Judge.
